# Summit finder

## What is it?
 
Summit finder is a web application that helps you approximate the highest point in a given radius.
 
## How does it work?
 
There's not a definitive solution on how to find the summit in an area on earth.
Basically the algorithm used to power this application will brute-force it by relying on several optimisations to get a better approximation with fewer requests.
